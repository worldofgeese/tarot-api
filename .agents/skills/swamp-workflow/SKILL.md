# Swamp Workflow Skill

Work with swamp workflows through the CLI. All commands support `--json` for
machine-readable output.

## CRITICAL: Workflow Creation Rules

- **Never generate workflow IDs** — no `uuidgen`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, or
  manual UUIDs. Swamp assigns IDs automatically via `swamp workflow create`.
- **Never write a workflow YAML file from scratch** — always use
  `swamp workflow create <name> --json` first, then edit the scaffold at the
  returned `path`, preserving the assigned `id`.
- **Never modify the `id` field** in an existing workflow file.
- **Verify CLI syntax**: If unsure about exact flags or subcommands, run
  `swamp help workflow` for the complete, up-to-date CLI schema.

Correct flow: `swamp workflow create <name> --json` → edit the YAML → validate →
run.

## Quick Reference

| Task               | Command                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Get schema         | `swamp workflow schema get --json`                     |
| Search workflows   | `swamp workflow search [query] --json`                 |
| Get a workflow     | `swamp workflow get <id_or_name> --json`               |

| List workflow data | `swamp data list --workflow <name> --json`             |
| Query wf data      | `swamp data query 'tags.workflow == "<name>"'`         |
| Get workflow data  | `swamp data get --workflow <name> <data_name> --json`  |

## Repository Structure

Workflow files are stored directly in the `workflows/` directory:

```
workflows/
  workflow-{uuid}.yaml
```

Internal data (evaluated workflows, run records) lives in `.swamp/`:

```
.swamp/workflows-evaluated/{uuid}.yaml
.swamp/workflow-runs/{workflow-id}/{run-id}.yaml
```

## IMPORTANT: Always Get Schema First

Before creating or editing a workflow file, ALWAYS get the schema first:

```bash
swamp workflow schema get --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "workflow": {/* JSON Schema for top-level workflow */},
  "job": {/* JSON Schema for job objects */},
  "jobDependency": {/* JSON Schema for job dependency with condition */},
  "step": {/* JSON Schema for step objects */},
  "stepDependency": {/* JSON Schema for step dependency with condition */},
  "stepTask": {/* JSON Schema for task (model_method or workflow) */},
  "triggerCondition": {/* JSON Schema for dependency conditions */}
}
```

## Create a Workflow

```bash
swamp workflow create my-deploy-workflow --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "name": "my-deploy-workflow",
  "path": "workflows/workflow-3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6.yaml"
}
```

The `id` is auto-assigned and **must not be changed**. Edit the YAML file at the
returned `path` to add jobs and steps.

**Example workflow file:**

```yaml
id: 3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6
name: my-deploy-workflow
description: Deploy workflow with build and deploy jobs
version: 1
inputs:
  properties:
    environment:
      type: string
      enum: ["dev", "staging", "production"]
      description: Target deployment environment
    replicas:
      type: integer
      default: 1
  required: ["environment"]
jobs:
  - name: build
    description: Build the application
    steps:
      - name: compile
        description: Compile source code
        task:
          type: model_method
          modelIdOrName: build-runner
          methodName: build
  - name: deploy
    description: Deploy the application
    dependsOn:
      - job: build
        condition:
          type: succeeded
    steps:
      - name: upload
        description: Upload artifacts
        task:
          type: model_method
          modelIdOrName: deploy-service
          methodName: deploy
          inputs:
            environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
```

## Scheduled Workflows

Workflows can declare a `trigger` section with a `schedule` cron expression for
automatic execution via `swamp serve`:

```yaml
id: 3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6
name: anime-downloader
trigger:
  schedule: "0 3,12 * * *"
jobs:
  - name: download
    steps:
      - name: fetch
        task:
          type: model_method
          modelIdOrName: downloader
          methodName: execute
```

When `swamp serve` starts, it scans all workflows and registers cron entries for
any with `trigger.schedule`. A filesystem watcher monitors for changes — adding,
modifying, or removing a schedule takes effect without restart.

**Key behaviors:**

- Overlap prevention: if still running from previous trigger, next trigger skips
- No catch-up: missed schedules while serve was down are not fired on startup
- Use `--no-schedule` on `swamp serve` to disable scheduled execution
- Health endpoint (`/health`) reports scheduled workflows and next fire times

## Edit a Workflow

**Recommended:** Use `swamp workflow get <name> --json` to get the file path,
then edit directly with the Edit tool, then validate with
`swamp workflow validate <name> --json`.

**Alternative methods:**

- Interactive: `swamp workflow edit my-workflow` (opens in system editor)
- Stdin: `cat updated.yaml | swamp workflow edit my-workflow --json`

## Delete a Workflow

Delete a workflow and all its run history.

```bash
swamp workflow delete my-workflow --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "deleted": true,
  "workflowId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "workflowName": "my-workflow",
  "runsDeleted": 5
}
```

## Validate Workflows

Validate against schema, check for structural errors, and verify that step
inputs match required method/workflow arguments.

**Checks performed:**

1. Schema validation (Zod)
2. Unique job names
3. Unique step names within each job
4. Valid job dependency references
5. Valid step dependency references
6. No cyclic job dependencies
7. No cyclic step dependencies within jobs
8. Step inputs match required arguments — for `model_method` tasks, checks that
   all required method arguments are provided in the step's `inputs:` block. For
   `workflow` tasks, checks that all required workflow inputs are provided.
   Dynamic CEL references (`${{ ... }}`) in model/workflow names are skipped.

```bash
swamp workflow validate my-workflow --json
swamp workflow validate --json  # Validate all
```

**Output shape (single):**

```json
{
  "workflowId": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "workflowName": "my-workflow",
  "validations": [
    { "name": "Schema validation", "passed": true },
    { "name": "Unique job names", "passed": true },
    { "name": "Valid job dependency references", "passed": true },
    { "name": "No cyclic job dependencies", "passed": true },
    {
      "name": "Step inputs for 'deploy' in job 'release' (my-app.deploy)",
      "passed": true
    }
  ],
  "passed": true
}
```

## Run a Workflow

```bash
swamp workflow run my-workflow
swamp workflow run my-workflow --input environment=production
swamp workflow run my-workflow --input environment=production --input replicas=3
swamp workflow run my-workflow --input '{"environment": "production"}'  # JSON also supported
swamp workflow run my-workflow --input-file inputs.yaml
swamp workflow run my-workflow --last-evaluated  # Use pre-evaluated workflow
```

**Options:**

| Flag                | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--input <value>`   | Input values (key=value repeatable, or JSON)                       |
| `--input-file <f>`  | Input values from YAML file                                        |
| `--last-evaluated`  | Use previously evaluated workflow (skip eval and input validation) |
| `--driver <driver>` | Override execution driver for all steps (e.g. `raw`, `docker`)     |

  "logs": "Building application...\nCompilation complete.",
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

## Workflow Inputs

Workflows can define an `inputs` schema for parameterization. Inputs are
validated against a JSON Schema before execution.

### Input Schema

```yaml
inputs:
  properties:
    environment:
      type: string
      enum: ["dev", "staging", "production"]
      description: Target environment
    replicas:
      type: integer
      default: 1
  required: ["environment"]
```

### Supported Types

| Type      | Description     | Example                                  |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `string`  | Text value      | `type: string`                           |
| `integer` | Whole number    | `type: integer`                          |
| `number`  | Decimal number  | `type: number`                           |
| `boolean` | True/false      | `type: boolean`                          |
| `array`   | List of items   | `type: array`, `items: { type: string }` |
| `object`  | Key-value pairs | `type: object`, `properties: {...}`      |

### Using Inputs in Expressions

Reference inputs with `${{ inputs.<name> }}`:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: deploy
    task:
      type: model_method
      modelIdOrName: deploy-service
      methodName: deploy
      inputs:
        environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
```

## Evaluate Workflows

Evaluate expressions without executing. CEL expressions are resolved; vault
expressions remain raw for runtime resolution.

```bash
swamp workflow evaluate my-workflow --json
swamp workflow evaluate my-workflow --input environment=dev --json
swamp workflow evaluate --all --json
```

**Key behaviors:**

- CEL expressions (`${{ inputs.X }}`, `${{ model.X.resource... }}`) are resolved
- forEach steps are expanded into concrete steps with resolved inputs
- Vault expressions (`${{ vault.get(...) }}`) remain raw for runtime resolution
- Output saved to `.swamp/workflows-evaluated/` for `--last-evaluated` use

## Allow Failure

Steps can be marked with `allowFailure: true` so their failure does not fail the
job or workflow. The step is still recorded as failed, but the failure is not
propagated.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: optional-check
    allowFailure: true
    task:
      type: model_method
      modelIdOrName: checker
      methodName: validate
```

- Step status remains `failed` with its error message
- The run output includes `allowedFailure: true` on the step
- Downstream `dependsOn: succeeded` steps will skip; `dependsOn: completed`
  steps will run

## Step Task Types

Steps support two task types:

**`model_method`** - Call a method on a model:

```yaml
task:
  type: model_method
  modelIdOrName: my-model
  methodName: run
  inputs: # Optional: pass values to the model
    key: ${{ inputs.value }}
```

**`workflow`** - Invoke another workflow (waits for completion):

```yaml
task:
  type: workflow
  workflowIdOrName: child-workflow
  inputs: # Optional: pass inputs to the child workflow
    key: value
```

Nested workflows have a max depth of 10 and cycle detection is enforced.

## Working with Vaults

Access secrets using vault expressions. See **swamp-vault** skill for details.

```yaml
apiKey: ${{ vault.get(vault-name, secret-key) }}
dbPassword: ${{ vault.get(prod-secrets, DB_PASSWORD) }}
```

Vault expressions are resolved **per-step at execution time** — a step that
writes to a vault makes the new value available to subsequent steps. Example
token-refresh-then-use pattern:

```yaml
jobs:
  refresh:
    steps:
      - name: refresh-token
        task:
          type: model_method
          modelIdOrName: token-refresher
          methodName: refresh
  use-token:
    depends_on: [refresh]
    steps:
      - name: call-api
        task:
          type: model_method
          modelIdOrName: api-client # vault.get() resolved after refresh
          methodName: invoke
```

## Workflow Example

End-to-end workflow creation:

1. **Get schema**: `swamp workflow schema get --json`
2. **Create**: `swamp workflow create my-task --json`
3. **Edit**: Add jobs and steps to the YAML file
4. **Validate**: `swamp workflow validate my-task --json`
5. **Fix** any errors and re-validate
6. **Run**: `swamp workflow run my-task`
