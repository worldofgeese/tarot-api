# Swamp Vault Skill

Manage secure secret storage through swamp vaults. All commands support `--json`
for machine-readable output.

## CRITICAL: Vault Creation Rules

- **Never generate vault IDs** — no `uuidgen`, `crypto.randomUUID()`, or manual
  UUIDs. Swamp assigns IDs automatically via `swamp vault create`.
- **Never write a vault YAML file from scratch** — always use
  `swamp vault create <type> <name> --json` first, then edit the scaffold at the
  returned `path`, preserving the assigned `id`.
- **Never modify the `id` field** in an existing vault file.
- **Verify CLI syntax**: If unsure about exact flags or subcommands, run
  `swamp help vault` for the complete, up-to-date CLI schema.

Correct flow: `swamp vault create <type> <name> --json` → edit config if needed
→ store secrets.

## Quick Reference

| Task              | Command                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| List vault types  | `swamp vault type search --json`                   |
| Create a vault    | `swamp vault create <type> <name> --json`          |
| Search vaults     | `swamp vault search [query] --json`                |
| Get vault details | `swamp vault get <name_or_id> --json`              |
| Edit vault config | `swamp vault edit <name_or_id>`                    |
| Store a secret    | `swamp vault put <vault> KEY=VALUE --json`         |
| Store from stdin  | `echo "val" \| swamp vault put <vault> KEY --json` |
| Store interactive | `swamp vault put <vault> KEY` (prompts for value)  |
| Get a secret      | `swamp vault get <vault> <key> --json`             |
| List secret keys  | `swamp vault list-keys <vault> --json`             |
| Migrate backend   | `swamp vault migrate <vault> --to-type <type>`     |

## Repository Structure

Vault configurations are stored directly in the `vaults/` directory, organized
by type:

```
vaults/
  {vault-type}/
    {vault-id}.yaml
```

Encrypted secrets (local_encryption vaults only) live in `.swamp/`:

```
.swamp/secrets/local_encryption/{vault-name}/
  .key          # Encryption key (NEVER commit)
  {secret-key}  # Encrypted secret data
```

## Vault Types

### Built-in Types

| Type               | Description                   | Key Config                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `aws-sm`           | AWS Secrets Manager           | `--region` or `AWS_REGION` |
| `azure-kv`         | Azure Key Vault               | `--vault-url` or env var   |
| `1password`        | 1Password via CLI             | `--op-vault` or `OP_VAULT` |
| `local_encryption` | Local AES-GCM encrypted files | Auto-generated key         |

See [references/providers.md](references/providers.md) for full configuration
details on each built-in type.

### User-Defined Types

Create custom vault implementations in `extensions/vaults/*.ts`. User-defined
vaults follow the `@collective/name` type format (e.g., `@hashicorp/vault`,
`@openbao/vault`).

See [references/user-defined-vaults.md](references/user-defined-vaults.md) for
the full implementation guide, export contract, and examples.

Vault types from trusted collectives (e.g., `@swamp/aws-sm`) auto-resolve when
referenced in vault configurations — no manual `extension pull` needed. Use
`swamp extension trust list` to see which collectives are trusted.

## Create a Vault

```bash
# Built-in types
swamp vault create local_encryption dev-secrets --json
swamp vault create aws-sm prod-secrets --region us-east-1 --json
swamp vault create azure-kv azure-secrets --vault-url https://myvault.vault.azure.net/ --json
swamp vault create 1password op-secrets --op-vault "my-vault" --json

# User-defined types (pass config as JSON)
swamp vault create @hashicorp/vault my-hcv --config '{"address": "https://vault.example.com:8200"}' --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "8f4e2d1c-9a3b-4c5d-ae7f-0a1b2c3d4e5f",
  "name": "dev-secrets",
  "type": "local_encryption",
  "path": ".swamp/vault/local_encryption/8f4e2d1c-9a3b-4c5d-ae7f-0a1b2c3d4e5f.yaml"
}
```

After creation, edit the config if needed:

```bash
swamp vault edit dev-secrets
```

## Store Secrets

**Inline value (appears in shell history):**

```bash
swamp vault put dev-secrets API_KEY=sk-1234567890 --json
swamp vault put prod-secrets DB_PASSWORD=secret123 -f --json  # Skip confirmation
```

**Piped value (recommended for scripts/CI — keeps secrets out of shell
history):**

```bash
echo "$API_KEY" | swamp vault put dev-secrets API_KEY --json
cat ~/secrets/token.txt | swamp vault put dev-secrets TOKEN --json
op read "op://vault/item/field" | swamp vault put dev-secrets SECRET --json
```

**Interactive prompt (recommended for humans — value is hidden):**

```bash
swamp vault put dev-secrets API_KEY
# Enter value for API_KEY: ********
```

Interactive mode (TTY, no `=`, no pipe) prompts with echo suppressed; piped
stdin reads the value and strips one trailing newline. Not available in `--json`
mode.

**IMPORTANT — agent security:** Never ask the user to paste or type a secret
value into conversation. Instead, instruct them to run `vault put` directly in
their terminal using piped input. This prevents secrets from being logged in
agent context or chat history.

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "key": "API_KEY",
  "status": "stored"
}
```

## Get a Secret

Retrieve a specific secret value from a vault.

```bash
swamp vault get dev-secrets API_KEY --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "key": "API_KEY",
  "value": "sk-1234567890"
}
```

**Note:** Use with caution. Secret values are sensitive and should not be logged
or displayed unnecessarily.

## List Secret Keys

Returns key names only (never values):

```bash
swamp vault list-keys dev-secrets --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "vault": "dev-secrets",
  "keys": ["API_KEY", "DB_PASSWORD"]
}
```

## Vault Expressions

Access secrets in model inputs and workflows using CEL expressions:

```yaml
attributes:
  apiKey: ${{ vault.get(dev-secrets, API_KEY) }}
  dbPassword: ${{ vault.get(prod-secrets, DB_PASSWORD) }}
```

**Key rules:**

- Vault must exist before expression evaluation
- Expressions are evaluated lazily at runtime, per-step in workflows
- Failed lookups throw errors with helpful messages

### Resolution Timing

Vault expressions are resolved **per-step at execution time** — each step gets a
fresh vault read. A step that writes to a vault makes the new value available to
all subsequent steps (e.g., token-refresh-then-use patterns).

**Never resolve a secret and pass the literal value.** This freezes the secret
at model creation time and prevents rotation or in-workflow refresh:

```bash
# WRONG — frozen at creation time
TOKEN=$(swamp vault get my-vault AUTH_TOKEN)
swamp model create ... --global-arg "token=$TOKEN"

# RIGHT — resolved fresh per-step
swamp model create ... --global-arg 'token=${{ vault.get(my-vault, AUTH_TOKEN) }}'
```

## Using Vaults in Workflows

For detailed workflow integration including the `swamp/lets-get-sensitive`
model, see the **swamp-workflow** skill.

**Quick syntax reference:**

```yaml
# In workflow step attributes
apiKey: ${{ vault.get(vault-name, secret-key) }}

# Environment-specific
prodToken: ${{ vault.get(prod-secrets, auth-token) }}
devToken: ${{ vault.get(dev-secrets, auth-token) }}
```

## Automatic Sensitive Field Storage

Model output schemas can mark fields as sensitive. When a method executes,
sensitive values are stored in a vault and replaced with vault references before
persistence — no manual `vault put` needed.

```typescript
// In an extension model's resource spec
resources: {
  "keypair": {
    schema: z.object({
      keyId: z.string(),
      keyMaterial: z.string().meta({ sensitive: true }),
    }),
    lifetime: "infinite",
    garbageCollection: 10,
  },
},
```

After execution, persisted data contains
`${{ vault.get('vault-name', 'auto-key') }}` instead of the plaintext secret.
The actual value is stored in the vault.

**Options:**

- `z.meta({ sensitive: true })` — mark individual fields
- `sensitiveOutput: true` on the spec — treat all fields as sensitive
- `vaultName` on the spec or field metadata — override which vault stores values
- `vaultKey` on field metadata — override the auto-generated vault key

A vault must be configured or an error is thrown at write time.

See the **swamp-extension-model** skill for full schema examples.

## Security Best Practices

Use separate vaults for dev/staging/prod to enforce environment separation.
