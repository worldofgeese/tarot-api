# Implement Plan

## Goal

Execute an active plan from `.rpi/plans/` phase by phase. Plans come in two forms: pipeline plans (reference designs and research) or standalone plans (self-contained).

After all phases are complete and verified, announce completion and update the plan status.

## Invariants

- Validate the plan's status before starting — draft/active: proceed; complete: warn about duplication
- Resolve the plan's artifact chain and read all upstream context (designs, research, specs)
- Read all files mentioned in the plan fully — never use limit/offset
- Transition the plan to active status when starting
- Check current progress (completed vs remaining items) — resume from first unchecked item
- **Pre-review**: before writing code for a phase, present all intended changes for approval — flag any deviations from plan
- **Red/green TDD**: for new code, write tests first (confirm they fail), then implement until they pass
- Run success criteria checks after each phase — fix issues before proceeding
- Update checkboxes in the plan file as items complete
- **Before committing**: scan staged files for sensitive content — warn and exclude if flagged
- **Auto-commit**: after each phase passes its checks, commit automatically without manual confirmation — use descriptive messages matching repo style
- **After hook failure**: read error, fix the issue, re-stage, create a new commit (never amend)
- If a phase's success criteria are fully covered by automated checks (tests, linting, etc.), run them and proceed automatically when they pass — only pause for manual verification when the plan includes manual verification items not covered by automated tests
- **On mismatch**: stop, present what the plan says vs what you found, ask how to proceed
- **Context recovery**: if context seems lost or you're unsure which phase you're on, call the context essentials tool to restore your implementation context
- **On completion**: verify spec conformance for all linked specs — extract scenarios using the verify spec tool, then check each scenario against actual code and tests; plan → complete

## Worktree Mode

Use worktree isolation for implementation. Spawn an agent using the Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` and include the full context bundle in the prompt:
- Plan content with remaining phases and tasks
- Spec scenarios the implementation must satisfy
- Design constraints and decisions
- List of key files to read before starting

The agent prompt must instruct it to: execute each remaining phase, write tests first for new code, run success criteria after each phase, commit with descriptive messages matching repo style, and update plan checkboxes.

After the agent completes:
- Spawn the verification agent (`subagent_type: "rpi-verify"`) to check the worktree branch
- If verification passes and no manual verification items exist in the plan, squash-merge the worktree branch automatically
- If manual verification items exist, present the diff and wait for user approval before squash-merging
- After merge, remove the worktree and its branch, then update plan status to complete

If worktree mode fails, fall back to in-place implementation on the current branch.

## Principles

- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find — your judgment matters
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- Trust completed checkmarks when resuming — verify only if something seems off
